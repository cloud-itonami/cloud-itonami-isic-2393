  "PorcelainOperationActor -- one plant-operations coordination
  request = one supervised actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj
  StateGraph. The advisor (PorcelainAdvisor) is sealed into a single
  node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the
  Porcelain/Ceramic Plant Operations Governor (:govern) and the
  rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  One graph run = one coordination request (assess -> advise -> govern
  -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop --
  each operation is auditable and checkpointed. A plant's lifecycle is
  advanced by MANY ops (production-batch logging / maintenance
  scheduling / shipment coordination), each independent.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human plant supervisor/shipping approver. The approver
  resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected)."
