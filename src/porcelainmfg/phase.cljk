  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the porcelain/ceramic-products
  (tableware, decorative ceramics, technical/industrial ceramics)
  plant-operations coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only          -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake    -- production-batch logging allowed,
                                    every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordinate -- adds safety-concern flags and
                                    shipment-coordination proposals,
                                    still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised-auto    -- adds maintenance scheduling (still
                                    always approval -- see below);
                                    governor-clean, high-confidence
                                    `:log-production-batch` (no
                                    physical/financial risk) may auto-
                                    commit.

  `:schedule-maintenance` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Scheduling real maintenance against
  a piece of equipment is the one act in this domain with physical
  consequence (a forming-line/kiln-line-equipment maintenance window
  means production downtime, and the equipment ends up actually
  touched); it is always a human plant supervisor's call.
  `porcelainmfg.governor`'s `forming-kiln-line-actuate-blocked-
  violations` HARD-blocks actuate attempts unconditionally, and the
  confidence/high-stakes gate independently never lets
  `:flag-safety-concern` auto-commit either -- multiple independent
  layers agree on where this actor's authority ends. Like every prior
  sibling's phase-3 `:auto` set, this domain has only ONE member
  (`:log-production-batch`) -- no separate no-risk lifecycle distinct
  from ordinary record logging.")
