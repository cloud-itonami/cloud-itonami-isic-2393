(ns porcelainmfg.sim
  "Demo driver -- `clojure -M:dev:run`. Walks a clean porcelain/
  ceramic-products plant through intake -> maintenance scheduling
  (escalate/approve) -> safety-concern flag (escalate/approve) ->
  shipment coordination (escalate/approve), then shows HARD-hold
  scenarios: a mis-wired request whose own `:effect` is not
  `:propose`, an unrecognized op, maintenance scheduled against an
  UNVERIFIED/unregistered equipment unit, a shipment coordinated
  against an UNVERIFIED/unregistered batch, a shipment proposal that
  would exceed the batch's own logged production weight, a proposal
  that tries to ACTUATE the forming line or kiln line directly
  (permanently blocked, no override), a double-schedule of the same
  maintenance window, a production-batch patch with a fabricated
  product type, a production-batch patch with an implausible
  glaze-defect-rate reading, and a production-batch patch with an
  implausible chip-resistance reading.

  Like every sibling actor's own demo, each check is exercised directly
  and independently below, one request per HARD-hold scenario, the SAME
  'exercise the failure mode directly, never only via a happy-path
  actuation' discipline `parksafety`'s ADR-2607071922 Decision 5 and
  every sibling since establish."
