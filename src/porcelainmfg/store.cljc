(ns porcelainmfg.store
  "SSoT for the porcelain/ceramic-products (tableware, decorative
  ceramics, technical/industrial ceramics) plant-operations
  coordination actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a
  swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*`
  actor in this fleet uses.

  Scope note: like its closest architectural sibling
  (`cloud-itonami-isic-2391`'s own `refractorymfg.store`, itself
  modeled on `cloud-itonami-isic-2431`'s `foundrymfg.store`), this
  build ships a single `MemStore` backend only (atom of EDN) -- the
  deterministic default for dev/tests/demo, no deps. Per
  docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1, this vertical is
  self-contained (no external porcelain/ceramic-products capability
  library, no jurisdiction-scoped Datomic-parity requirement driving a
  second backend); a `langchain.db`-backed store can be added later
  behind the same protocol without changing any caller.

  Four kinds of entity live here:
    - `batches`          -- the central entity. A production batch (a
                             kiln-fired lot of porcelain/ceramic ware)'s
                             product-type/weight/glaze-defect-rate/
                             chip-resistance record. `:verified?` marks
                             whether the batch's own claims have
                             actually been QC-inspected (never
                             inferred from a routine intake patch);
                             `:registered?` marks whether it is on
                             file in the plant's production ledger;
                             `:shipped-weight-kg` tracks the batch's
                             own cumulative-shipped ground truth.
    - `equipment`         -- a forming-line/kiln-line unit's own
                             record. `:verified?`/`:registered?` track
                             whether it has actually been
                             inspected/commissioned and is on file --
                             the same ground-truth discipline as
                             `batches`.
    - `maintenance`       -- a scheduled forming-line/kiln-line-
                             equipment maintenance-window DRAFT
                             against a piece of equipment
                             (`porcelainmfg.registry`'s
                             `register-maintenance`). Dedicated
                             `:scheduled?` double-schedule guard (never
                             a `:status` value -- the same discipline
                             every prior governor's guards establish,
                             informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s
                             status-lifecycle bug, ADR-2607071320).
    - `shipments`         -- a proposed outbound porcelain/ceramic-
                             product shipment DRAFT
                             (`porcelainmfg.registry`'s
                             `register-shipment`).

  Plus a generic `records` map (id -> raw record) used only for
  direct, domain-agnostic `commit-record!` calls (a record with no
  `:effect` key) -- the store-level primitive every sibling actor's
  own MemStore exposes underneath its domain-specific commit dispatch.

  The ledger stays append-only: 'which batch was logged, which
  maintenance was scheduled against a verified/registered equipment
  unit, which shipment was coordinated and at what
  independently-recomputed weight, approved by whom, which safety
  concern was flagged' is always a query over an immutable log -- the
  audit trail a plant owner or downstream buyer trusting this
  coordinator needs."
