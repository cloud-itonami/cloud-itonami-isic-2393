(ns porcelainmfg.advisor
  "PorcelainAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for the
  porcelain/ceramic-products (tableware, decorative ceramics,
  technical/industrial ceramics) plant-operations coordination actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (product-type/weight/
  glaze-defect-rate/chip-resistance), drafts a forming-line/kiln-line-
  equipment maintenance scheduling proposal against a piece of
  equipment, drafts a safety-concern flag, and drafts an outbound
  porcelain/ceramic-product shipment coordination proposal against a
  production batch. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor. It
  returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it cited), never
  a committed record and NEVER a real forming-line/kiln-line actuation
  or freight dispatch. Every output is censored downstream by
  `porcelainmfg.governor` before anything touches the SSoT -- see
  README `What this actor does NOT do`.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) --
  `porcelainmfg.governor` HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a
  mis-wired caller can never reach a commit path even if this advisor
  were compromised."
