  "Porcelain/Ceramic Plant Operations Governor -- the independent
  compliance layer that earns the PorcelainAdvisor the right to
  commit. The advisor has no notion of whether a piece of equipment it
  wants to schedule maintenance against has actually been inspected/
  registered, whether a batch it wants to coordinate a shipment
  against has actually been QC-verified/registered, whether a
  maintenance proposal secretly tries to ACTUATE (rather than merely
  draft-schedule) the forming line or kiln line, whether a shipment
  proposal's own claimed weight would blow through the batch's own
  logged production weight, or when an act stops being a coordination
  proposal and becomes direct forming-line/kiln-line-equipment
  control, so this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a
  proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:porcelain-ceramic-plant-operations-governor`
  (see docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes
  gate (SOFT -- asks a human to look, and the human may approve):

    1. Request-level propose-only  -- did the CALLER's own request
                                       actually declare `:effect
                                       :propose`? Any other value is a
                                       mis-wired/compromised caller
                                       trying to bypass proposal-only
                                       mode -- HARD, unconditional,
                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one
                                       of the four propose-shaped
                                       effects? A proposal effect
                                       outside this set (e.g. a
                                       hallucinated `:kiln-line/actuate`
                                       or `:forming-line/run`) is the
                                       'direct forming-line/kiln-line-
                                       equipment control' scope
                                       violation this actor must NEVER
                                       perform -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional.
    4. Forming/kiln-line-actuate
       blocked                     -- for `:schedule-maintenance`, does
                                       the proposal's own `:value`

                                       kiln-line? true`? Directly
                                       actuating the forming line or
                                       kiln line is this actor's other
                                       permanent scope boundary (see
                                       README `What this actor does
                                       NOT do`) -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional. NO phase and NO
                                       human approval can ever override
                                       this (see `porcelainmfg.phase`:
                                       this op is never a member of any
                                       phase's `:auto` set either -- two
                                       independent layers agree).
    5. Equipment not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced equipment's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`porcelainmfg.registry/
                                       equipment-ready?`) -- never trust
                                       the advisor's own rationale about
                                       verification/registration
                                       status. Grounded in this
                                       blueprint's own HARD invariant
                                       ('plant/batch record must be
                                       independently verified/

                                       maintenance must never be
                                       scheduled against equipment
                                       whose own conditions have not
                                       actually been inspected or
                                       whose registration is not
                                       actually on file.
    6. Already scheduled           -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       refuses to schedule the SAME
                                       maintenance record twice, off a
                                       dedicated `:scheduled?` fact
                                       (never a `:status` value).
    7. Batch not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced batch's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`porcelainmfg.registry/batch-
                                       ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale. Also
                                       part of the 'plant/batch record'
                                       HARD invariant: a batch's own
                                       verified/registered status is as
                                       much a ground-truth fact as an
                                       equipment unit's own.
    8. Shipment weight exceeded    -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:shipped-weight-kg` plus
                                       the proposal's own claimed
                                       `:weight-kg` would exceed
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:weight-kg`
                                       (`porcelainmfg.registry/
                                       shipment-weight-exceeded?`) --
                                       ground truth from the batch's
                                       own permanent fields, never a
                                       self-reported weight claim.
    9. Invalid product-type        -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares a
