  "The governor contract as executable tests -- this vertical's own
  scope boundary ('does NOT control the forming line or kiln line
  directly... does NOT authorize or execute maintenance/kiln-line
  operations') implemented faithfully. The single invariant under
  test:

    PorcelainAdvisor never schedules maintenance, flags a safety
    concern, or coordinates a shipment the Porcelain/Ceramic Plant
    Operations Governor would reject; `:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-
    safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` NEVER auto-commit at any
    phase; `:log-production-batch` (no physical/financial risk) MAY
    auto-commit when clean; and every decision (commit OR hold) leaves
    exactly one ledger fact."
