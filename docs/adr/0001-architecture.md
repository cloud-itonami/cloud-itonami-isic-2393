# ADR-0001: PorcelainAdvisor ⊣ Porcelain/Ceramic Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-2393` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-2393` publishes an OSS blueprint for porcelain/
ceramic-products (tableware, decorative ceramics, technical/industrial
ceramics) plant **operations coordination** (production-batch product-
type/weight/glaze-defect-rate/chip-resistance data logging, forming-
line/kiln-line-equipment maintenance scheduling, safety-concern
flagging, and outbound porcelain/ceramic-product shipment
coordination). Like every actor in this fleet, the blueprint alone is
not an implementation: this ADR records the governed-actor
architecture that promotes it to real, tested code, following the
same langgraph StateGraph + independent Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout
pattern established across the cloud-itonami fleet.

The closest architectural analog is `cloud-itonami-isic-2391`
(Manufacture of refractory products): both are back-office
coordination actors for a fixed processing PLANT with heavy
kiln-firing equipment and a real physical safety dimension, and both
share the same four-op shape (`:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-
maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment`) and the
same two-entity verified/registered gate structure (equipment for
maintenance scheduling, batch for shipment coordination). The two
verticals are, however, distinct plants with distinct hazard profiles
and distinct product/quality vocabularies: 2391's central physical
hazard is a hot, high-temperature-service kiln-firing line (refractory
products must themselves withstand furnace-service temperatures) plus
refractory-dust exposure and pressing-line pinch-point hazard, while
2393's is the bisque/glost kiln-firing line plus glaze-material-safety
hazard (lead/cadmium leaching risk from non-compliant glazes -- lead-
free glaze compliance is a well-documented regulatory concern for
ceramic tableware) and forming-line-equipment pinch-point hazard
(jiggering/jolleying machine, RAM press). This build mirrors 2391's
architecture closely but adapts the hazard profile and equipment/
product vocabulary to the porcelain/ceramic-products plant: 2393's
permanent equipment-actuation block guards a forming line/kiln line
(`:actuate-forming-kiln-line?`) rather than a pressing-line/kiln line
(`:actuate-kiln-pressing-line?`); and 2393's production-batch record
declares a `:product-type` (spanning porcelain, bone-china, stoneware,
earthenware tableware plus decorative, art-pottery, technical-ceramic
and ceramic-insulator families, per ISIC 2393's own combined scope), a
`:glaze-defect-rate-percent` reading (percent of the batch with a
visible glaze defect -- a porcelain/ceramic-specific quality data
point with no direct 2391 analog -- glazed tableware and decorative
ware is graded by surface-finish defect rate, unlike unglazed
refractory brick), and a `:chip-resistance-newtons` reading (an edge
chip-resistance test relevant to tableware/decorative ware durability),
rather than 2391's `:thermal-shock-cycles`/`:cold-crushing-strength-
mpa` pair.

`cloud-itonami-isic-2393` is also distinct from `cloud-itonami-isic-2392`
(Manufacture of clay building materials, a construction-material
brick/tile vertical with its own building-material firing profile) --
which this build does not depend on or wrap.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/porcelainmfg`-style
capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). This build
therefore uses self-contained domain logic -- pure functions in
`porcelainmfg.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-
weight recompute, product-type validation, glaze-defect-rate
plausibility validation, chip-resistance plausibility validation) are
re-verified independently by the governor, the same "ground truth, not
self-report" discipline established across prior actors (most directly
`cloud-itonami-isic-2391`'s `refractorymfg.registry`, itself modeled
on `cloud-itonami-isic-2431`'s `foundrymfg.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:porcelain-ceramic-plant-operations-governor`, is grep-verified UNIQUE
fleet-wide (`gh search code "porcelain-ceramic-plant-operations-governor"
--owner cloud-itonami`, zero hits before this repo was created); the
`porcelainmfg` namespace prefix is likewise grep-verified UNIQUE
fleet-wide (`gh search code "porcelainmfg" --owner cloud-itonami`,
zero hits before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external porcelain/ceramic-products capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
porcelain/ceramic-products vertical has NO pre-existing capability
library to wrap. The equipment/batch-verification / shipment-weight /
product-type / glaze-defect-rate / chip-resistance validation
functions live as pure functions in `porcelainmfg.registry` and are
re-verified independently by `porcelainmfg.governor` -- the same
"ground truth, not self-report" discipline established across prior
actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-2391`'s
`refractorymfg.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of porcelain/
ceramic-products plant operations. It does NOT:
- Control the forming line or kiln line equipment directly
- Make plant-safety or glaze-material-safety decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor)
- Actuate the forming line or kiln line

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority --
it is a proposal-screening and documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY BOUNDARY**: porcelain/ceramic-products manufacturing
is a safety-critical domain (kiln-firing thermal/burn hazard at the
bisque/glost firing zones, glaze-material lead/cadmium safety,
silica-dust exposure, forming-line pinch-point hazard, heavy material
handling). Safety-concern flagging NEVER auto-commits. All safety
concerns escalate immediately to human review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (kiln-safety/thermal-hazard concern,
radiant-heat exposure, glaze-material-safety concern -- lead-free
glaze compliance, silica-dust-hazard exposure, forming-line-equipment
safety concern, crew fatigue) ALWAYS escalates, never auto-commits.
This is not a "low-stakes proposal" -- it is a circuit-breaker that
must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Like `cloud-itonami-isic-2391`, this vertical has TWO entity kinds
each gating a different op: `:schedule-maintenance` independently
verifies the referenced **equipment** unit's own `:verified?`/
`:registered?` fields; `:coordinate-shipment` independently verifies
the referenced **batch**'s own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields.
Both are the same "plant/batch record must be independently verified/
registered before any action" HARD invariant applied to the two
distinct record kinds this domain actually has.
`:coordinate-shipment` additionally independently recomputes whether a
batch's own recorded shipped-to-date weight plus the proposal's own
claimed weight would exceed the batch's own recorded production
weight -- never taken on the advisor's self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into eleven concrete checks
in `porcelainmfg.governor`, matching `cloud-itonami-isic-2391`'s own
eleven -- this vertical's `:glaze-defect-rate-percent` plausibility
check replaces 2391's `:thermal-shock-cycles` check, and its
`:chip-resistance-newtons` plausibility check replaces 2391's
`:cold-crushing-strength-mpa` check, per Decision 1's own
field-vocabulary decision above) block proposals and cannot be
overridden by human approval:
1. Plant/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's weight must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production weight
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Direct forming-line/kiln-line-equipment control or forming/kiln-line actuation is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed -- `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Porcelain/ceramic-products plant operations back-office now has a
documented, governed, auditable coordination layer that funnels all
decisions through independent validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into eleven concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep into
unauthorized equipment operation or forming/kiln-line actuation.
Safety concerns are a circuit-breaker, not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation and forming/kiln-line operation
remain human-controlled via external channels.

(-) No integration with real plant-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch) -- this is a standalone
coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-2393`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), `clojure
  -M:lint` clean, `clojure -M:dev:run` demo narrative exercises
  proposal submission, escalation, and every HARD-hold scenario
  directly (not-propose-effect, unknown-op, equipment-not-verified,
  batch-not-verified, shipment-weight-exceeded, forming-kiln-line-
  actuate-blocked, already-scheduled, invalid-product-type, invalid-
  glaze-defect-rate, invalid-chip-resistance).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) -- no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.
